# HTML-Practice-Pages

This is a repo containing multiple folders.
Each Folder contains practice HTML/Javascript/CSS files that I made in my spare time to practice using frameworks.
I would like to note that the UI look a bit boring because I'm not use to creating UIs by myself. I usually work with a UI Designer.
